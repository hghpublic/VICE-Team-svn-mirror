CMake can now be used to generate an alternative build system. Example usage:

	# Generate a Unix Makefiles project in current working directory:
	# (Note: this replaces the original configured Makefiles)
	cmake .

	# Generate a Unix Makefiles project in a build directory:
	cmake -B <build directory>

	# Or:
	mkdir <build directory>
	cd <build directory>
	cmake ..

	# Generate an Xcode project in a build directory:
	cmake -G Xcode -B <path to build directory>

Run cmake --help to see a list of supported project generators on this platform.
